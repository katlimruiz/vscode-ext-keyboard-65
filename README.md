# vscode-ext-keyboard-65

Have you being excited to buy a new 65% keyboard, only to realize that your F12 key is not working anymore?. **This extension is for you!**

This extension will reassign all the default Mac keybindings that work with Function Keys (e.g. `F12` or `Fn+F12`) to work with `Cmd+Shift` (e.g. `Cmd+Shift+=`).

## Restrictions

-   The keybindings are for Mac `ABC` Input Source (Settings > Keyboard > Input Sources).

## Considerations

-   My tests were done using my EPOMAKER TH-68PRO ISO-ENGLISH (bought in 2024).

## Future

-   Support other input sources (e.g. `ES`)
