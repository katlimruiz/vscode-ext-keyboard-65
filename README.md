# vscode-ext-keyboard-65

Have you being excited to buy a new 65% keyboard, only to realize that your F12 key is not working anymore?. **This extension is for you!**

This extension will reassign all the default Mac keybindings that work with Function Keys (e.g. `F12` or `Fn+F12`) to work with `Cmd+Shift` (e.g. `Cmd+Shift+=`).

## Restrictions

-   The keybindings are for Mac `ABC` Input Source (Settings > Keyboard > Input Sources). `ABC` is English.

## Considerations

-   My tests were done using my EPOMAKER TH-68PRO ANSI-ENGLISH (bought in 2024).

## Roadmap

-   Support other input sources (e.g. `ES`). This requires to detect input source.
-   Support to enable/disable the extension.

## Notes:

-   Why not buying a 75% keyboard? Well, that would've been the best if I would've knownb this was going to happen :chuckles.
-   Why not using hidutil? Because mostly I only need Function Keys inside VSCode.
-   Why not using Karabiners? Because I don't want to run a third party software just for this. Remapping keys in VSCode should be faster to execute (although not 100% perfect).
